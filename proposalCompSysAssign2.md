##Project Description
For the Computer Systems and Networking Module Assignment 2 I am proposing the following project: to design and implement a smart chicken house.
Some of the features may include:
1.	A timer to open and close the chicken house at a certain time of the day with the possibility to be overridden. 
2.	A temperature sensor set to trigger a heater to come on inside the chicken house when the temperature drops below a certain level.
3.	A counter to track chickens coming out and going back inside the house in the mornings and evenings with an alert sent to the user if the count is short.
4.	A speaker to call the chickens inside the house at dusk with a pre recorded chicken call :) 
5.	A grain sprayer inside the chicken house to work with the speaker to entice the chickens inside.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment: not very exact at the moment, certainly subject to future change. 
Raspberry Pi 3B+
Raspberry Pi Sense Hat
Relay module 
Arduino micro controller, IDE
Programming language: Python (not decided on IDE)
