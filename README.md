Networking using connected devices, CompSys Assignment 2.

This is a simple IoT project called smart Chicken Coop. Raspberry PI and a SenseHat are installed inside the Chicken House. Raspberry PI is connected to the Internet via WiFi. SenseHat monitors the inside temperature at all times and sends the readings to the Users Smart phone via Blynk app and displays them to the User at all times while the application is online and running. The user can control chickenâ€™s environment live through the app. The app allows the User to turn on and off External and Internal Lights, the Heater inside the Coop and the Feeder in the chicken yard as well as open and close the Chicken Coop gate. As the temperature is monitored all the time by the SenseHat the Heater will come on automatically if the temperature falls below a certain level.
The User can also take a picture through the Blynk app of the Chicken Coop and view it on a website.
